# Consumer-Complaint-Analysis-AIOPS-PROJECT-

Project Overview
This project aims to design and build a scalable machine learning pipeline to predict whether a consumer complaint will be disputed or not. The pipeline will be deployed on a cloud platform and exposed as an API for easy access. The project also includes integration with an online MySQL database for metadata storage, logging of actions performed by the code, and optimization of the solution at both the code and architecture levels.
